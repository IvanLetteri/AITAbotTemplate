# Statistical_Modeling_for_Time_Series_Forecasting
The **DeFi tokens** are analysed using popular statistical models such as **SARIMA**, **ETS** and **GARCH**. Additionally, a powerful open source forecasting package from Facebook, called **Prophet**, is also explored and used to generate forecasts.

# Acquiring Data and Data Preprocessing
The **DeFi tokens** market **Prices** are scrapped from Binance with own library in python. The data is then cleaned and used to build 2 other important time series: DeFi tokens **Returns** (percent change in Prices) and **Volatility** (Magnitude of Returns). All these steps are in the `Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The 3 time series from above are explored using techniques like:
- Line and Box Plots
- Density Curves
- Decomposition Plots (Additive and Multiplicative)
- Smoothing Functions (Moving Average Smoothing)
- Correlation Plots (ACF and PACF)
- Stationarity Checks (ADF and KPSS tests)

The insights gained from these exploratory techniques help the model building process. All the steps here are in `Visualization and EDA.ipynb` notebook.

# SARIMA
## SARIMA on DeFi tokens Returns
Here, the SARIMA class of models are used to model and forecast a stationary time series: DeFi tokens Returns. The steps for this model are in `Returns Models/SARIMA For DeFi-tokens_Returns.ipynb` notebook.

## SARIMA on DeFi tokens Prices
Here, the same models are used for a non-stationary time series: DeFi tokens Prices. The trick used (data transformation) to model this series successfully and other details of the model are in `Prices Models/ARMA Model for DeFi-tokens_Prices.ipynb` notebook.

# ETS
The notebook `Returns Models/Exponential Smoothing Models for DeFi tokens Returns.ipynb` contains all 3 types of ETS models fitted on DeFi tokens Returns

# GARCH
The Volatility of the DeFi tokens Returns are modeled and forecasted using this model. The code for the same is in `Volatility Models/GARCH for DeFi-tokens_Volatility.ipynb` notebook.

# ARMA-GARCH
Here a combination of the 2 models (ARMA and GARCH) is used to model the DeFi tokens Returns. First the ARMA model is used to fit the Returns, and later the residuals generated by the ARMA model are modeled using the GARCH model. The code for this is in `Returns Models/ARMA-GARCH For DeFi tokens Returns.ipynb` notebook

# Facebook Prophet
Facebook has developed a powerful time series forecasting tool called Prophet. In this analysis only a subset of its features are explored. The official [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html) of the package contains many many useful features that can assist almost anyone tackling a time series data. The code used to fit the prophet model to this data is in the notebook: `Prophet Models/Prophet for DeFi tokens Prices and Retruns.ipynb`.

**Note:** Most of the packages used in this analysis are standard and will be present in most python environments. For downloading prophet locally you can follow the steps [here](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html#python) or just run the `!pip install fbprophet` command in a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) code cell if you are working there.
